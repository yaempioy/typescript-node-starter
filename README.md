## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected. 

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using `npm run build`

| Name | Description |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **.vscode**              | Contains VS Code specific settings                                                            |
| **dist**                 | Contains the distributable (or output) from your TypeScript build. This is the code you ship  |
| **node_modules**         | Contains all your npm dependencies                                                            |
| **src**                  | Contains your source code that will be compiled to the dist dir                               |
| **src/config**           | Passport authentication strategies and login middleware. Add other complex config code here   |
| **src/controllers**      | Controllers define functions that respond to various http requests                            |
| **src/models**           | Models define Mongoose schemas that will be used in storing and retrieving data from MongoDB  |
| **src/public**           | Static assets that will be used client side                                                   |
| **src/types**            | Holds .d.ts files not found on DefinitelyTyped. Covered more in this [section](#type-definition-dts-files)          |
| **src**/server.ts        | Entry point to your express app                                                               |
| **test**                 | Contains your tests. Seperate from source because there is a different build process.         |
| **views**                | Views define how your app renders on the client. In this case we're using pug                 |
| .env.example             | API keys, tokens, passwords, database URI. Clone this, but don't check it in to public repos. |
| .travis.yml              | Used to configure Travis CI build                                                             |
| .copyStaticAssets.js     | Build script that copies images, fonts, and JS libs to the dist folder                        |
| package.json             | File that contains npm dependencies as well as [build scripts](#what-if-a-library-isnt-on-definitelytyped)                          |
| tsconfig.json            | Config settings for compiling server code written in TypeScript                               |
| tsconfig.tests.json      | Config settings for compiling tests written in TypeScript                                     |
| tslint.json              | Config settings for TSLint code style checking                                                |
